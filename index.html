        <em>Challenging Conditions Every Day In Developing Countries</em>

    <p class="content">
      Safe drinking water is a problem for nearly 1 billion people. Many of these people are women and young girls in the developing world who must walk an average of 6 kilometers each day to collect often contaminated water for their families.

        How Does This Impact Children's Health?
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Diarrhea caused by drinking contaminated water is still a leading cause of illness and death among infants and children in the developing world. Over 1000 children die every day as a result of diseases that cause diarrhea. What does this mean? More children
        die from diarrheal illnesses such as cholera, dysentery and typhoid fever, than from HIV/AIDS and malaria combined.

        How is the P&G CSDW Program Helping?
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        P&G collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a technology that people can use in their home to purify water. The P&G Purifier of Water packet improves the quality of household stored water and greatly reduces the
        risk of illness and death.

      <p>
        What can I do to help the program succeed?
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Consider a monthly donation. The results can be dramatic. Simply providing clean, purified, drinkable water can reduce the risk of disease and death by about 50 percent.
